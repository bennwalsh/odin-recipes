    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>beef </li>
        <li>300g breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>split burger buns</li>
        <li>lettuce tomatos and onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble the mince in a large bowl, then tip in the breadcrumbs, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, parsley and
            eggs with 1
            tsp ground pepper and 1-2 tsp salt. Mix with your hands to combine everything thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Shape the mix into 12 burgers. Chill until ready to cook for up to 24 hrs. Or freeze for up to 3 months.
            Just stack
            between squares of baking parchment to stop the burgers sticking together, then wrap well. Defrost overnight
            in the
            fridge before cooking.</li>
        <li>To cook the burgers, heat grill to high. Grill burgers for 6-8 mins on each side until cooked through.
            Meanwhile, warm
            as many buns as you need in a foil-covered tray below the grilling burgers. Let everyone assemble their own,
            served with
            their favourite accompaniments.</li>
    </ol>
